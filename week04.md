# HW Week 4
## Study Group Assignment:
1. [Sorting Hat](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/EVENTS_sorting_hat.md) - Each person should have their own github repo, github project, cards, and mockups.  Plan together and then code individually.

## Individual Assignment
1. [Personal Bio Site #2](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/personal-bio-site-instructions/blob/master/personal-bio-site-02.md).  Use the repo you made for part 1.  This should be a short assignment - but you should still make a card or two in a github project for the work before you start.
