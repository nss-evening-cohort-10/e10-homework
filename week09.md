# HW Week 9

## Study Group Assignment:
1.  [Solar System](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/solar_system.md) - create a github project, write tickets, and get coding.  This should be a quick assignment - if you are getting super stuck somewhere you are overthinking.


## Individual Assignment(s):
1.  READMEs - make sure all your assignments have a completed README.md file see [THIS](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-1-foundations/chapters/markdown.md) resource to know what completed means.

2.  Open Assignments - we have a group project starting next week.  It would be best if you are done with EVERY assigned assignment before then.  Remember - its not complete if it doesn't have a readme.
