# HW Week 2
## Study Group Assignment:
1. [Product Cards](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/HTML_CSS_product_cards.md) Each person should make a girhub repo called product-cards and a local folder in this location: `~/workspace/foundations/exercises/product-cards`.  You should be using flexbox.  Decide as a team how many branches you will need and what will happen on each branch (remember one feature per branch).

## Individual Assignment(s):
1.  Have 30 repos pushed to github (test1-test30). Each of these repos should live here: `~/workspace/foundations/exercises/`.  DO NOT DO ALL REPOS ON THE SAME DAY.  Maximum of 5 repos per day.  Each repo should have:
  * Each repo should start with a README.md file that you push to master branch
  * Each repo should have a setup branch. This branch should have 3 files - index.html, main.css, and main.js. The index.html file should have html boilerplate, link to the CSS file, script tag to the JS file. The css file should change the background color.  The JS file should have a console.log of your choice
  * There should be PR from the setup branch to the master branch
  * Before you merge the PR - your code should be properly indented and clean (consistent appropriate spacing)
  * Final result for a repo should have everything merged into master
